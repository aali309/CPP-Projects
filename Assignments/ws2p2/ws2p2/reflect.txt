	I learnt how to dynamically allocate memory and then deallocate. This style is good to use the exact memory. The m_description uses static memory and it loses some data when data is entered beyond that stored and if less memory is preserved but not used this leads to memory wastage. The m_pattern uses dynamic allocated memory. It uses the exact amount of memory needed and no memory is wasted. This style of dynamically allocating memory is good when you do not know the exact memory you will be using hence allocated during run time when it is known. I also learnt that it is important to track the dynamically allocated pointer and make sure it is in scope. Make sure to also deallocate the memory that was allocated to avoid memory leaks. It is optional though advisable to later put it to a null address because it will prevent the program to delete the original address.
	Also I learnt about global functions and how to call them. You use the “.” Method just like the way you are trying to access a member of a structure. The difficulties that I had is to refer back to the variable names and access them correctly when asking for user input or printing.That we also use "strcpy" to copy all the elements from one element to the new allocated memory.
