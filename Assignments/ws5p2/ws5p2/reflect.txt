In this assignment I practiced more on dynamic memory allocation and to manipulate array size. It was quite complicated because this is the first time, I did a program which dealt with allocating dynamic memory three times. This also brought to consideration that the memory has to be cleaned up for all the dynamically allocated arrays. The explicit specifies that the conversion function is explicit and cannot be used for implicit conversions (cannot be done without being triggered by the user). It resolves some unwanted circumstances like stopping the compiler to do automatic conversion which may lead to lose of data. Unless the programmer specifies explicitly, the compiler will generate error. If removed it will bring the ambiguity in automatic conversion by the compiler from one type to another resulting to unwanted data, loss of data or wrong results (i.e. calculations) and sometimes signs as well.
The operator cannot be a member of the class because it will generate error. We already have the same operator that takes one parameter. To overload the operator we need to make it global instead. This will enable the overload and when called it will not generate errors since this function takes two parameters.
